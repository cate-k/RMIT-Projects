    br
    .skill-table
    br
    p The soft skills listed above are a staple for any career. When all team members demonstrate a willingness to better these skills, the organisation runs smoothly and efficiently. Employers will often choose to hire someone with a good offering of soft skills and low amount of technical skill than someone with the opposite ratio. This is due to it being easier for employers to teach someone to be technical, than it is to teach them to be more empathetic.
    br
    p As with most IT-specific skills, employers rank these highly (for their specific needs, of course). This is simply due to the more 'technical' state of computing. The ability to think logically is not natural for humans. Our brain has evolved to jump to conclusions as it is much quicker, and ultimately better for our safety, to do so. Having the ability to think through logical steps at the micro level, while still maintaining comprehension at the macro, is a skill that many struggle to perfect.
