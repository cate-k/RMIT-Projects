As well as the importance of time management, resources management, money management and more importantly responsibility. We find ourselves with an advantage as we directly harvest the information from our very own young team member. Providing us with a real insight of what children could be driven by, what motivates them and what makes them strive for progress, to develop themselves into better and more responsible adults, offering a better outcome in life.</p><br><p class="sub-heading">Why is this project important or interesting?</p><p>As previously mentioned, this project is important as we would like to create more responsible human beings. Ready to confront the reality of adulthood as well as, create accountability.</p><br><p>What make the project more interesting is where and from whom the idea came from.</p><br><p>Creating more importance to the development of this application since we need to stand behind the ideas of younger generations. Help develop them and push those generations to persevere till the ideas become reality.</p><br><p class="sub-heading">How does it fit with the current IT trends?</p><p>ChoreKingdom fits into the following IT trends:</p><ul class="list"><li>Cloud Computing: As the application will require customers and members information to be stored for record keeping and management, ChoreKingdom will need to develop their own cloud system or acquire a cloud service provider.</li><li>Blockchain: Throughout the reward process, ChoreKingdom decided to adopt payment of the completed chores by using crypto currency.</li><li>GPS Tracking: The application provides the capability to track the members belonging to management account. This, providing a progress of the chore or activity assigned as well as a providing a safety blanket of the location of the members.</li></ul><br><p class="sub-heading">What would it show to a future employer if we were able to work on this project?</p><p>While this program is not intended to be provided to another company for sale, instead remaining in-house, the project itself is a good demonstration of how we, as a group, handle these specific technologies and how they interact with each other inside the app. This would demonstrate great teamwork by showing how each team member’s specific skills have been leveraged to create a single functioning app.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Landscape</p><p class="sub-heading">What similar systems or products are available?</p><p>There are currently over 10+ chore applications in both IOS and Android app stores. This creates a big competitive market for ChoreKingdom. However, most applications such as Allowance and Chores Bot, FamZoo, Chore Checklist and OurHome, do not focus in kids chores. In contrast, ChoreKingdom, focuses on the importance of family interaction and the development of children for a more realistic world.</p><br><p class="sub-heading">What competitors are there?</p><p>S’moresUp is a more direct competitor to ChoreKingdom. By focusing on the nurture of more responsible, independent, self-managed and financially savvy kids (Rotation 5 LLC, 2019).</p><br><p class="sub-heading">What points of difference are there about your project compared to what exists now?</p><p>ChoreKingdom provides a more immerse interaction for the kids. By adding more of what they could want such as: in-game points redemption, video games and toys purchase. It also gives parents the ability to broaden their latest fintech knowledge by providing them and their kids access to 3 major crypto currencies.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Aims</p><p class="sub-heading">What are the most important parts of the project?</p><p>Wildcard(*) finds, the interaction between parents and kids the most important part of the project. Secondly, we see the development of financially savvy and responsible kids being a key factor to prepare them for adulthood. Thirdly, ability to provide remuneration to the company itself for upkeep and continue development.</p><br><p class="sub-heading">Which part should have a priority over others?</p><p>Many start-ups only look at the numbers when it comes to developing a business. However, we find that key factor to a healthy business growth are:</p><ul class="list"><li>Communication</li><li>Organization</li><li>Task allocation</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Commitment</li></ul><br><p>We also require prioritizing internal testing and customer feedback in order to perform as intended.</p><br><p class="sub-heading">If we have only enough time or resources for one of our goals, which one should it be?</p><p>The development and testing of the application should be a priority. As we can continue to develop the whitepaper once a workable application has reached a level of maturity.</p><br><p class="sub-heading">Plans and Progress</p><p>The development and testing of the application should be a priority. As we can continue to develop the whitepaper once a workable application has reached a level of maturity.</p><br><p>The prototype started with a clean Sign in screen with pastel colors. At the top an image of a sitting fox. In the middle, an email and password prompts to access the members profile.</p><br><p>Next, we have the Home Screen, where members see their username and are instantly asked a question on what they would like to do. Their options are simple. They can choose to see the list of chores they have assigned, access the overdue chores previously tasked and lastly, see and access their children’s profiles.</p><br><p>Chore List screen, shows the list of chores such as: take and sort mail, clean room, wash dishes, give the dog a bath, fold laundry, etc. It also, displays the reward they earn by completing the chore. In this case it is a monetary reward.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Roles</p><p>There are a few basic roles that need to be filled within this project, bearing in mind that the development of a project is a dynamic thing. Some of these roles can be transient in nature and will allow the team to work on different tasks as the project progresses. These roles include, programming the back-end web services, building and programming the app itself (including UI design), finance and time management, task allocation, application and web services security, and finally blockchain integration services. These would be the bare necessities to build the functionality described in the above sections. With these functionalities met, the project is in a great spot to mature and grow into the future.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Scope and Limits</p><p>To have an initial workable project, the primary goal will be to have a functional, if somewhat basic, application that looks good, tracks tasks, transfers payments to and from users and is able to secure user's data. This would be the bare minimum we would be comfortable releasing to the general public for use.</p><br><p>Past this initial phase of maturity, the app will then move forward by incorporating multiple payment and reward methods, integration with grading systems for the tracking of performance at school, health data tracking and monitoring, financial training and tracking.</p><br><p>There will be several things that won't be included with the app immediately. This will include the GPS location tracking, as we need to further discuss how to implement this without being predatory.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Tools and Technologies</p><p>There are quite a few things that will be required to get this project up and running. Aside from the mobile device or tablet this app will be built for, we will need an understanding of the languages and programs used to design Android and iOS applications. For Android, we will be using Java within an IDE called Eclipse. Whereas, when it comes to the iOS app, we will be using the programming language Swift within the AppCode IDE.</p><br><p>Stepping up from the specific hardware needs, we will need to incorporate a payment system into app that will be able to accept credit/debit cards, as well as make and receive payments. Integrating the functionality of companies like PayPal or Square will allow us to achieve this goal.</p><br><p>For the purposes of tracking usage, connecting users, managing updates and providing ongoing support, we will be employing the use of a cloud computing solution. This will include storage and networking capabilities for our applications. A suitable platform would be Amazon Web Services.</p><br><p>When it comes to the security of our users, we will be employing several technologies to assure our user's data will be protected. We will be using end-to-end encryption for all data sent and received from our cloud system, on-board data encryption for stored data, we will be using authorized PayPal or Square APIs, authentication will be multifactor (including iris or fingerprint) and security will be baked into our application right from the beginning.</p><br><p>Moving into the future, we will be integrating geolocation into ChoreKingdom by employing the use of the Global Positioning System to track tasks and add an extra element of safety for the children.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Testing</p><p>We will move forward with testing as soon as we have the basic components outlined in the 'Scope and Limits' section completed. First, we will allow 50 or so people from our immediate network of friends, colleagues and family to get the first instance of the app. This way we can work out any immediate bugs and implement quality-of-life fixes. Once we are certain the app performs as expected, we will expand that net to include an additional 950 people and begin to stress test the app and underlying cloud systems. If we are confident and ready to proceed, we will release the app to the world.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Timeframe</p><br><div class="timeframe-table"></div><br><br><p class="heading">Risks</p><p>We are aware of a few risks that may present themselves when we move forward with the release of ChoreKingdom. As with any app that collects user data, including financial information, there is always the risk that an unauthorized person will want to collect that data. If we are unable to secure our app properly, the information that may be collected is user login information, names, address data, payment information such as card numbers, account numbers, payment history, etc. In the later edition of our app, user's location data will also be at risk of misappropriation.</p><br><p>On the back end of the app, the cloud system could be misconfigured, resulting in a loss of data and up-time. In the case of this or a malicious act like ransomware, we will need to have adequate backups of all data ready to go at a moment's notice.</p><br><p>There is also a risk that the Swift language may be somewhat different to Java, resulting in more time taken to create the iOS variant of the app.</p><br><p>If the documentation that comes with the PayPal or Square APIs is not enough, delays may be met, or security issues may arise if the software is implemented incorrectly.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Group Processes and Communications</p><p>Through the process of creating this application, our group will be working entirely remotely. There will be no central office where the work is completed. Instead, we will be communicating by a social networking application like Discord or Slack. There will be set meetings times several times a week for everyone to catch up and tasks to be delegated in a more formal setting. However, communications will not be limited to these windows of time. With the nature of social networking as it is, communication can be available at any time of the day. Our team members can access these communication channels when they need and check back later for a reply, if need be.</p><br><p>If there is a lull in communication from a member, their tasks will be absorbed by the group and outside expertise acquired of those tasks require specialized knowledge.</p><br><br></body></html>
