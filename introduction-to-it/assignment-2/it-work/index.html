(InkDrop is a markdown note taking application made for developers.)</p><br><p>He started developing for companies however he never found any drive to work for them as he was only treated as a software engineer. Working for a company was never pleasurable for him as all he would do was to code.</p><br><p>After quitting his company job, he decided to work as a freelance developer. He quickly found out that earning money from developing was hard since he couldn't find a way to profit from his developing applications. Takuya had to do some freelance work for start-ups on 6-months contracts which allowed him to earn some money.</p><br><p>After 6 years of developing, he managed to get InkDrop off the ground, allowing him to start earning some money. InkDrop is a markdown note taking application made for developers.</p><br><p>He strives through challenging environments such as the development and expansion of his app. Takuya finds it exciting as he has to deal with marketing, user support and product improvement on a day to day basis.</p><br><p>Takuya works most of his time alone from home and has currently no clients as his main focus is InkDrop.</p><br><p>Software developing has given Takuya the opportunity to see his job not as a job but as a way of life, allowing him to have freedom on his app development and build whatever he wants.</p><br><br><p class="sub-heading">Application Developer</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLccZMTLsmQ">A Day as an iOS Developer at Sixt</a>, Sixt Karriere, 2019.</p><br><p>Jesus works as an app developer for Sixt in Germany, he uses Xcode to do conduct his iOS development.

During meetings, he interacts also with his boss as well as other co-workers located around the world. Their approach towards their boss is informal as there is a chill-vibe around the whole office.</p><br><p>He spends most of his time on his desk, meeting rooms, game room and cafeteria.</p><br><p>The most challenging part of his job is that responsibility falls on him. At own pace jobs, individuals are left alone as they are expected to complete tasks and meet deadlines.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Paul</p><br><p class="sub-heading">Web Developer</p><p>What kind of work is done by a web developer?</p><ul class="list"><li>Design, create and maintain websites</li><li>Create consistent and efficient web applications and services</li><li>Software development</li></ul><br><p>What kind of people do web developers interact with?</p><ul class="list"><li>Mainly with clients and management to discuss the needs of a website</li></ul><br><p>Where does the web developer spend most of their time?</p><ul class="list"><li>Most of them spend 50-60% of their day doing projects for clients</li></ul><br><p>What aspect of their position is the most challenging?</p><ul class="list"><li>Internet Explorer – mainly the biggest challenge they face</li><li>Latest web standards</li><li>User Experience</li></ul><br><p class="sub-heading">Network Administrator</p><p>What kind of work is done by a network admin?</p><ul class="list"><li>Installing and configuring computer network</li><li>Consulting with clients to specify system requirements</li><li>Working with IT support personnel</li></ul><br><p>What kind of people does a network admin interact with?</p><ul class="list"><li>Technicians</li><li>Clients</li><li>Project Managers</li></ul><br><p>Where does the network admin spend most of their time?</p><ul class="list"><li>Looking for bottlenecks</li><li>Taking calls for technicians</li><li>Maintaining log files</li></ul><br><p>What aspect of their position is the most challening?</p><ul class="list"><li>Security – never ending threats are on the rise</li><li>Monitoring and regular maintenance</li></ul><br><br></body></html>
