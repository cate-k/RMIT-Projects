(Lexico Dictionaries | English, 2019) Whether it's your home computer or a multinational corporation's network infrastructure, the fundamentals remain the same; prevent people without authorisation accessing data.</p><br><p>NIRVANA KAI (NICT NEWS 2018-472, 2019) is an integrated analysis platform that makes the task of sifting through the many event logs generated daily and presents them in a clear fashion ranked by order of priority. The aggregate also displays information on the associations within the network made by the detected malware so that less time is spent locating the root cause.</p><br><p>This program also offers auto-actuation, wherein once an emergent threat is detected an automated user-defined process can take effect to limit the spread or communication of the malware. Alongside the analytical functions and auto-actuation, NIRVANA KAI offers complex traffic monitoring and real-time virtualisation options.</p><br><p>NIRVANA KAI-II (NICT NEWS 2018-472, 2019) is a platform that allows for integrated organisational vulnerability management. This system allows for a 'birds-eye view' of an organisations network architecture with vulnerable systems highlighted for ease of reference. This allows a faster response to emerging threats and the ability to recognise potential vulnerabilities immediately, thus saving escalating issues as well as requiring fewer human resources.</p><br><p>AI has already become part of the solution when it comes to cybersecurity. This technology crossover is still emerging, though, so with time the capabilities are to be expansive.</p><br><p>Below are a few uses for several different types of machine learning. (Polyakov, 2019)</p><br><p>Generative models can be used to create an iteration on something based on previous knowledge. This can be used to iterate through naming conventions to find copied files, for example, login_1.php or login_backup.php, etc created by malware or hackers.</p><br><p>Association Rule Learning (Recommendation Systems) can be used to recommend a response based on knowledge gathered. This system could recommend marking false positives, alter risk values and run investigations.</p><br><p>Regression can be used to identify fraudulent actions, such as suspicious transactions, locations, detect anomalies in HTTP requests (XXE and SSRF attacks and authorisation bypass).</p><br><p>As the algorithms used to makeAI become more effective, the range of use become more mature as well. Systems for detecting and combatting intrusion will become commonplace. This begs the question; will the black hats also follow this trend? That will be interesting. As cybersecurity has always been a card game, where each side slowly one-ups the opposing team, there is no reason to think that AI will not fall into the hands of the black hat.</p><br><p>As the number of devices coming online increases, so too do the number of avenues for attack. With those numbers increasing faster than the numbers of people skilled enough to combat them, it seems as if the battle is being lost. However, with advancements in machine and deep learning carrying on, analysts will be able to keep up with the increase of surface area their networks are exposed to.</p><br><p>The people who will be most affected by the advancements of AI will be organisations who can afford to utilise these technologies. Until such a time arises where the every-man can obtain this tech to shore up their own home networks, they will be the low hanging fruit for the mindless copy-paste script kiddies.</p><br><p>This technology may very well send some jobs to the grave. However, it is best to see AI as a complimentary source of protection. There is still a lot that it cannot do. Security analysts will adopt these technologies into their day-to-day tasks. While their job may still exist, the tasks they will be doing will be different.</p><br><p>Coming into this industry at the same time as AI is making a surge in popularity, leaves me in a great position to come in contact and grow with these technologies.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Leo</p><br><p class="sub-heading">Cloud Services</p><p>Cloud Services are computer services over the internet (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/">What is cloud computing, Azure</a>). Individuals and businesses are now generating a lot of data. Pictures, videos, messages and even critical documents are making their way to our digital world. As individuals we now finding the need store and access our datafrom anywhere around the world. The physical device transportation of data, however, is not feasible anymore due to device compatibility, storage and processing power. Cloud services provide an easier way to store, access and manage what is important, locally and remotely. Businesses are also finding the need for cloud services. They can now manage their network, databases, software, storage and servers.</p><br><p>People expect to be able to save a picture, access a file, continue a conversation and upload a video in real time. Services such as: iCloud, Google drive, WhatsApp and YouTube make it possible. Since individuals want continuous and quick access to all their data in real time, they are happy to use a cloud service provider of their choice.</p><br><p>As previously mentioned, cloud services, are not except to individuals. Businesses are handling a lot of data online, such as: booking flights, ordering food, requesting Uber services, etc. Services and product providers are finding the need to adopt cloud services. This, to better access, manage and control their business and customer data more efficiently and at a lower cost.</p><br><p>Here are some of the reasons why businesses would like to run their operations through cloud services.</p><ul class="list"><li>For businesses to host a website, they require servers. The more servers, the more money.</li><li>Traffic represents also a problem. The more traffic goes into their servers, the more servers would be needed to host high traffic levels.</li><li>Trouble shooting is also another concern, as it is time consuming and takes from business resources.</li><li>In addition, during low traffic periods, up-scaling could represent a cost; since low peaktimes causes servers to idle. Representing a cost and an excess of resources.</li></ul><br><p>Cloud services are becoming more available to everyone. However, both individuals as well as business need to be aware of the impact cloud services can have on their privacy and operations accessibility which as a business can affect them economically and strategically. As individual, can affect them as they may have their data and private information stolen.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Paul</p><br><p class="sub-heading">Autonomous Vehicles</p><p>The term describes itself â€“ driverless, without the use of your hands on the steering wheel, but coming to where the car takes fully control in terms of controlling right to where it doesn't a driver nor a steering wheel.</p><br><p>As we are evolving into the future, more of these will be released into the public and there are already a few out on the market, e.g. Teslas, Google.</p><br><p>These driverless cars use a range of technology to gauge their surroundings such as GPS, radar, laser light, odometry and computer vision. Currently there are a few cars out there which are part driverless, but you must take over when needed like assisted parking and self-braking features. Google is hoping to release the Google Chauffeur software in the market by 2020.</p><br><p>Sensors are required for most driverless cars and are used in most safety features such blind spot, lane assistance, forward collision warning and cameras are provided to navigate the car in a safe manner.</p><br><p>Having connectivity allows the cars to have access to the latest traffic reports, weather, road conditions, nearby construction work and the data collected is used to monitor a car's surrounding to anticipate braking or avoid hazardous conditions.</p><br><p>Software controls and algorithms are needed to get the data from the sensors and connectivity and make the decisions on steering, braking, speed and route guidance.</p><br><p>The algorithms must be able to handle a multitude of simple and complex driving situations flawlessly and the software used must be fault-tolerant.</p><br><p>What is the likely impact?</p><p>It has been predicted that autonomous vehicles will contribute $800 million annually when they are fully deployed. The benefits will be cost savings with reduced crashes, fuel efficiency and better access to transportation. Traffic congestion will be low because of fewer accidents on the road and having autonomous vehicles allow smoother flow of traffic.</p><br><p>Driverless cars will use electric power because they will be harder to operate with fossil fuels. There would be many jobs created from the new technology in developing the new infrastructure required to charge electric batteries, and so on. This would also mean a move away from fossil fuel transport to a less polluting form of energy with fewer carbon emissions â€“ reducing the effect on global warming.</p><br><p>In the future, autonomous cars may contribute very little to unemployment. The projected increase in the unemployment rate by autonomous vehicles is between 0.06 and 0.13 percent during the decade from 2045 to 2055, according to an assessment by economist Erica Groshen published in a June 2018 report by Securing America's Future Energy.Companies are currently hiring engineers, technicians, software developers and designers to build autonomous vehicles.</p><br><p>Only 3.8 million of those workers operate motor vehicles such as a truck or taxi. Among those workers, truck drivers are more vulnerable to automation because they drive mainly on highways, and that type of navigation is easier to automate than negotiating city streets. The remaining 11.7 million, who drive as part of job positions such as mail carriers, firefighters and emergency medical technicians, are likely to benefit from new technology.</p><br><p>It is an amazing technology at hand with so many features and is user friendly as well. It will definitely be great in terms of traffic flow and congestion with reduced accidents on the road. With new technology, everything will be perfect in terms speed applied, brakes and control required for the autonomous vehicle. For myself I do more than 140km of driving a day so this will be useful for me and the autonomous vehicle will take over when I'm tired and prevent me from causing any accident on the road.</p><br><p>When this will be deployed out, it will take me fair while to purchase this car and it will be quite expensive to have.</p><br><p>This wouldn't affect any members of my family or friends because they will have the same outcome as myself.</p><br><br></body></html>
