If we had been off to a start a little earlier, that would have been better. The team was enthusiastic and never complained about tasks. Groupwork is challenging, but it's ideal for breaking complex tasks into steps, sharing different perspectives, and developing new approaches to solving problems.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Jesse</p><p>As with many new ventures, things can take some time to get rolling. I feel that this is exactly what happened with this team. It took us a few days to get into the swing of things, but once we did, the report and website were completed relatively quickly. As we grew comfortable with each other, communication became easy and discussion was had. Despite two members being absent, the remaining four were willing to pick up the slack. I believe this has put us in a strong position for group tasks going forth.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Leo</p><p>After a slow start,the team started by collecting as much information as possible. From there,we commenced to breakdown and put all information together. We quickly realized that group work was hard. Being so far apart from each other created an even bigger challenge. As we were only using social media/cloud services to communicated and continue with the work. Everyone adapted to the challengesand helped in areas where others had less experience.</p><br><br><p class="heading">Paul</p><p>Doing online study can be quite challenging as it is. At first, the group work was a bit daunting for me, as I haven't done any studies for a while now. I joined this group because my group wasn't active all the time and I knew I needed to get the ball rolling with Assignment 2. When I joined this group, everyone was really welcoming. Still, it took a while for everyone to get to know one another and get comfortable. One thing I noticed with this group was everyone had different strengths which is a big asset for any group. Once we had the ball rolling, there was no turning back, even though we had two of our other team members away. However, that didn't become an issue with the four of us.</p><br><br></body></html>
